Connect 4

Connect 4: is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs into a six-column, seven-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal line of four of one's own discs.
